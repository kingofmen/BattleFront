\section{Basic design}

The base mechanic is armies, which have
\begin{itemize}
\item Size
\item Position
\item Facing
\item Freshness
\end{itemize}

Each iteration, each army does damage to all enemy armies
within \$DISTANCE. Damage is proportional to size and freshness,
inversely to square of distance, and (1+\cos\theta) where \theta
is the angle between the inflicting army's facing and the line between
the centers of the armies. Damage takes the form of reducing size
and changing position by moving the damaged army away from the inflicting one. 
The proportion depends on the stance of the army, from
"attack at all costs" (90\% size damage) to "elastic defense" (10\% size). 
In hard terrain position damage is reduced. 

Armies always advance along their facing if there is no enemy army within
\$DISTANCE2, and if they don't have defensive-type orders. 

Freshness is updated when the army receives reinforcements (which also represent
supplies). Reinforcements are created at a central location and move across 
roads and rail to their target army, shrinking all the while. The closer a reinforcement
unit is to an enemy one, the more it shrinks. 

User input:
\begin{itemize}
\item Facing of armies
\item Destination of reinforcements
\item Production priority between reinforcement and infrastructure
\item Aggression of armies
\end{itemize}

Victory consists in having an army within \$DISTANCE of the enemy's 
reinforcement location.
